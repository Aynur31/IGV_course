---
## What is IGV?

- Created by the Broad institute.
- Genome browser.
    - Visualises genomic data (expression, ChIP, resequencing, multiple alignment, shRNA)
    - Handles most common genomic data types.
Java Desktop application
    - No dependence on server
    - Loads data locally or from URL, consumes memory and CPU.

---
## How to run IGV?

- Requires Java
- IGV available from Broad

## Are there we there yet?

- The human genome isnt complete! 
- In fact, most model organisms's reference genomes are being regularly updated.
- Reference genomes consist of mixture of known chromosomes and unplaced contigs called a  **Genome Reference Assembly**.
- Major revisions to assembies result in change of co-ordinates.
- Requires conversion between revisions.
- The latest genome assembly for humans is GRCh38.
- Patches add information to the assembly without disrupting the chromosome coordinates . i.e GRCh38.p3

---
## Genome Reference Consortium.

- GRC is collaboration of institutes which curate and maintain the reference genomes for 3 model organims.
    - Human - GRCh38.p3
    - Mouse - GRCm38.p3
    - Zebrafish - GRCz10
- Other model organisms are maintained separately.
    - Drosophila - Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, BDGP36

---
## Why do we need to know about reference genomes
- Allows for genes and genomic features to be evaluated in their linear genomic context.
    - Gene A is close to Gene B
    - Gene A and Gene B are within feature C.
- Can be used to align shallow targeted high-thoughput sequencing to a pre-built map of an organisms genome.

## A reference genome

- A reference genome is a collection of contigs.
- A contig is a stretch of DNA sequence encoded as A,G,C,T,N.
- Typically comes in FASTA format.
    - ">" line contains information on contig
    - Lines following contain contig sequence
